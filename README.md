# CODEX-Pre-Qualification-Test

The objective of this repository is to show the resolution of the exercises proposed in CODEX-Pre-qualification test for the Summer Internship Program. Each exercise will also have a `README.md` file to show more information about the resolution and what was used on it.

## Folder Structure

The project is a React JS website, so more than the default Create React App files and folder, from which some unnecessary ones were removed, in `/src` was created five more folders: `/pages`, `/components`, `/exercises`, `/styles` and `/config`. In order to make more explicit and easy to find the resolution of each exercise, each one of them has it own folder inside `/exercises`. Their folder contains a `/components` folder with the React components, and the files used in the resolution, besides that there is a `README.md` file with more details.

## Git Workflow

I will use a new branch for each exercise and merge it into main only when it is completed. The new branchs will be named to refer to the exercises and, as an example, the exercise 1 will be on a branch named "exercise-1''.

## How to run the code

All the exercises can be saw and/or executed in this website: link for the website still unavailable. It contains a menu for accessing which one of the exercises. In case that an exercise doesn't need a code, the menu can be used to access the referent resolution, and in case that an exercise was not solved, there will be a page that shows a message informing that.

## About the website

The website was built using React JS with Typescript initialized with Create React App. The deployment was made using Firebase.
