# Exercise 2 - Test if two rectangles intersect

## About the resolution

In this resolution i used TDD (Test-driven development), so at first i used Jest to create test cases with rectangles that intersect and that do not. Then, in the coding process when i had implemented the function to check if two rectangles intersect, i could test if it was correct just running the tests. Therefore, i implemented all the functions to check the intersection in the file `checkRectanglesIntersection.ts`.
