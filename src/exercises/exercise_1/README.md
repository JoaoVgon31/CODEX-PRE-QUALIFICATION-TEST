# Exercise 1 - Validate CNPJ format and check digits

## About the resolution

In this resolution i used TDD (Test-driven development), so at first i used Jest to create test cases that covered all the exercise requirements. Then, in the coding process when i had implemented a new validation, i could test if it was correct just running the tests. Therefore, i implemented all the functions that validate the CNPJ in the file `validateCNPJ.ts`, using the pseudocode defined by _Receita Federal_ to verify the check digits.
